  "Part-time MBA student, full-time overthinker. I once cried because my Maggi turned out soggy and now I have trust issues. Manifesting free WiFi and an emotionally available crush.",

  "I studied engineering to make my parents proud, but now I run a meme page and explain reels to them over dinner. One day I‚Äôll go viral ‚Äî if not for talent, then definitely for my relatives‚Äô drama.",

  "Broke but bougie. I attend online webinars with my video off and pretend I‚Äôm taking notes. Fluent in Hinglish, emoji, and sending ‚ÄòK?‚Äô as a threat. Still waiting for my big break... or a biryani sponsorship.",

  "I believe in destiny, karma, and the holy trinity of Rajma Chawal, power naps, and midweek existential crises. Currently surviving on deadlines, dopamine hits, and daily doses of cringe Insta reels.",

  "Coding by day, crying by night. My toxic trait is starting new projects every weekend and abandoning them faster than my gym resolutions. Catch me romanticizing my life while refreshing GitHub stats.",

  "Raised on DD National and emotional manipulation. I say ‚Äòbro‚Äô 43 times a day and pretend I know what I‚Äôm doing. My dog has more followers than me, and honestly, he deserves it.",

  "Ex-tuition topper, now a recovering LinkedIn motivational quote poster. I once got ghosted by a recruiter and I‚Äôm still not over it. Living proof that ‚Äòacha beta hai‚Äô can write slightly toxic JavaScript.",

  "Once called ‚ÄòSharma ji ka beta‚Äô‚Ä¶ until I became a UX designer. I enjoy ruining UI with 15 different font choices and calling it minimal. Ask me about my startup idea that will never launch.",

  "Too filmy for tech, too techie for film. I like long walks to the fridge, deep conversations with ChatGPT, and pretending I understand crypto. Side hustle? Giving life advice to strangers on Reddit.",

  "Will fight anyone who disrespects dahi puri. My career plan is 20% hard work and 80% vibes. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm thriving or just really good at faking productivity on Notion.",
